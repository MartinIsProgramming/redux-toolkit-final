# Redux Toolkit

With the new "createStore deprecated" message in Redux we need to start
thinking about how we can start moving our projects to the new Redux toolkit (which the core team of Redux mention as the recommended now).

Although the team mentioned that is just a visual message for the developers, it will eventually force our projects to move to the "new way" of using Redux.

In this project you have all you need to know to get started and use a couple of important features from Redux-toolkit such as:

- The new configureStore
- Slices
- And the new RTK for cashing data from the server

```
npm i
```

Create your own file `.env.local` with the `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`

```
npm run dev
```
